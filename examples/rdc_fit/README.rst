Fit Tensor to RDC Data
======================

This example shows how to fit a :math:`{\Delta\chi}`-tensor or equivalently, and alignment tensor to experimental RDC data. These data are taken from a Tb3+ tagged ubiquitin mutant:

Script + Explanation
--------------------

Firstly, the necessary modules are imported from paramagpy. And the two RDC datasets are loaded. Because this PDB contains over 600 models, loading may take a few seconds

Two starting metals are initialised. It is important here to set the magnetic field strength and temperature.

The alignment tensor is solved using the function :py:func:`paramagpy.fit.svd_fit_metal_from_rdc` which return a tuple of ``(metal, calculated)``, where metal is the fitted metal, calculated is the calculated RDC values. The tensors are then saved. Note that we set the argument ``ensembleAverage`` to ``True``. This is important because the PDB structure represents and MD simulation. If set to False, a much smaller tensor would be fit.

The experimental/calculated correlations are then plotted. The tensor is by default fitted to the ensemble averaged calculated values. Backcalculation of all models is shown here, as well as the ensemble average.
